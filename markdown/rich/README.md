These are copies of the files from [Rich](https://pypi.org/project/rich/)
9.3.0 that I hand-modified to suit my preferences.

Rich is part of my strategy for personal notes. Since there were only 41
million note-taking systems out there, I thought it might be faster to
simply build my own to suit, rather than spend the days & weeks trying to
find somebody else's vision that approximated mine.
